# MOVIA
Movies statistics and recommender system

MOVIA is a statistics an recommender system for movies. Follows you can find a brief explanation of each modules:

The "PI_ETL_Phase.ipynb" IPython Notebook is a notebook that performs the Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL) process for a project called MOVIA. Through code and text cells, various operations are carried out to prepare the data for analysis and visualization.

Here's a general overview of the notebook's flow:

    Importing libraries: Necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib are imported to perform ETL operations and data visualization.

    Data extraction: A CSV data file is loaded using the pd.read_csv() function from the pandas library. The data is stored in a DataFrame for further processing.

    Data exploration and cleaning: Exploratory analysis is conducted to understand the data structure and quality. This involves checking for missing values, removing duplicates, correcting data formats, and performing necessary transformations.

    Data transformation: Various transformations are applied to the data to prepare it for analysis. This may include calculating new columns, grouping, data filtering, and format manipulation.

    Data analysis and visualization: Data analysis and visualization techniques are used to derive meaningful insights. This may involve generating charts, tables, and statistical summaries to highlight patterns, trends, and relationships in the data.

    Loading transformed data: Once the data has been cleaned and transformed, it can be saved to a new CSV file or another format for future use in the MOVIA project.

The notebook contains both code cells and explanatory text cells, making it easier to understand each step of the ETL process.
